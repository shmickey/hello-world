# hello-world
this is only a test.
at the moment im working in a hotel, listening to bunch of children screaming and playing with each other, mainly because their mother left them in the lobby in order to participate in prying inside the synagog.
im left with the souting and the natural and annoying behavior of children who unfornatly act their age.
